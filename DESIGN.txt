sx64 CPU Design
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: This design is a work in progress, not all sections are finished.


General Idea
------------
The sx64 is a simple 64-bit CPU architecture designed for clarity and ease of use. It aims to be distinct from architectures like x86, AArch64, and RISC-V by focusing on a minimalistic and straightforward design for efficient instruction processing.

Registers
---------
- General Purpose Registers (R0-R7):
  Eight 64-bit registers used for general data storage and computation. They hold values for operations, arguments, return values, counters, and pointers.

- Special Purpose Registers:
  - SB (Stack Base): 64-bit register holding the base address of the stack. The stack grows upwards.
  - SP (Stack Pointer): 64-bit register pointing to the top of the stack. It updates as data is pushed or popped.
  - IP (Instruction Pointer): 64-bit register holding the address of the current instruction. It updates to point to the next instruction.
  - FR (Flags Register): 16-bit register storing condition flags (Zero, Carry, Overflow, Sign) for arithmetic and logical operations.

Instruction Format
------------------
The sx64 architecture follows a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) model. This means that the instructions vary in size, with the length of each instruction dynamically changing based on its opcode. The flexibility in instruction size allows for a richer set of operations and potentially more compact code.

Startup and Initialization
--------------------------
On startup, the sx64 CPU zeros out all registers. It then sets the Instruction Pointer (IP) to the address of the system bootstrap code (sys-bootstrap) to initialize hardware and the CPU. After this, it jumps to the kernel bootstrap code (krnl-bootstrap) to load the operating system kernel. Specific addresses for these bootstraps are unknown.

The sx64 CPU design is part of the Sphynx Projects / OS, a work in progress by Kevin Alavik. For more information, visit github.com/sphynxos or sphynx.shittydev.com. Contact Kevin Alavik at kevin@alavik.se or kevin@shittydev.com for further inquiries.
